### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD researcher @[**Cologne Center for Comparative Politics**](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/). My research interests are ♀️ women and political leadership, gendered power, and gendered institutions ♀️. For now, I am focusing on quantitative and machine learning methods in R and Python. My supervisor is 🔥 [**Chitralekha Basu**](https://www.chitralekhabasu.com/).

Also I like 🐱 cats, 🌶️ sichuan food, and 👚 vintage clothes. And I'm a mom to an amazing 👼​ little boy.

## What I'm working on ✍️

**“Parties, portfolios, and power”**: This project examines the role of parties in the gendered dynamics of portfolio allocation in coalition governments. I am interested in the impact of women party leaders in the appointment of women to the most powerful cabinet positions.

**“Using word embeddings to uncover gender bias in political speech”**: Building on recent literature that examines social biases in word embedding models, I develop an approach to quantify gender bias in political speech.

## What I'm learning 🤔
- Transfer learning for supervised and unsupervised models.
- The ins and outs of ↕️ multi-level modeling, rare events modeling, and hierarchical data.
- Applying word embedding models to political text.
