### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD researcher @[**Cologne Center for Comparative Politics**](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/). My research interests are ♀️ women and political leadership, gendered power, and gendered institutions ♀️. For now, I am focusing on quantitative and machine learning methods in R and Python. My supervisor is 🔥 [**Chitralekha Basu**](https://www.chitralekhabasu.com/).

I am also an impact evaluator, with a focus on feminist, trauma sensitive, and qualitative methodologies. Formerly @[**medica mondiale**](https://medicamondiale.org/en) and UNAIDS.

## What I'm working on ✏️

- **The gendered dynamics of cabinet formation: Parties, portfolios, and power**:
Here, I examine the role of party dynamics in the gendered allocation of cabinet portfolios. In coalition governments, it is the constituting parties rather than the head of government who decide ”who gets what” in the cabinet. As party elites are more likely to be male, I argue that during the early rounds of coalition
negotiations, many of the most important ministerial positions are claimed by men. I find that while portfolio importance does not have a straightforward impact on the allocation of cabinet portfolios to
women, women in party leadership positions have a very significant positive impact on women’s representation. This finding suggests that more analytical attention directed at who holds power in the process of portfolio allocation contributes to our understanding of persistent gender inequalities at the highest levels of government.
